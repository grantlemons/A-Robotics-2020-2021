# Robotics code 2020-2021
We were online most of this year and didn't actually get the chance to participate in a competition. We also had almost all new members and were not very efficient. Due to some of the limitations of the robot I was only able to actually code when I was connected to the same network as it, which severely limited productivity, especially since it was after-school on friday afternoons.

## Here is the current configuration of the robot:

WEBCAM_NAME = `webcam`\
LEFTFRONT_NAME = `purple`\
RIGHTFRONT_NAME = `orange`\
LEFTBACK_NAME = `red`\
RIGHTBACK_NAME = `black`\
PUSHER_SERVO = `servo0`\
THROWER_MOTOR = `green`\
PICKUP_MOTOR = ``
